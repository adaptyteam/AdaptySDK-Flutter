# 2.2.0
Meet the second version of the Adapty SDK ðŸŽ‰

See our [What's new in Adapty Flutter SDK 2.0 doc](https://docs.adapty.io/v2.0/docs/migration-to-flutter-2) for API updates.
Adapty 2.0 introduces the following updates:

## Breaking changes:
- Adapty now is singleton. Use `Adapty().someMethodCall()` instead of `Adapty.someMethodCall()`
- User-initiated purchases are now automatically processed by the system, so we have removed the `deferredPurchasesStream` and `makeDeferredPurchase()` method.
- We are no longer support Visual Paywalls and Promo Campaigns features, so you should remove the calls to the corresponding methods, if there were any
- Instead of getting all paywalls in one request with the `.getPaywalls()`, it must be done separately for each paywall using `.getPaywall(id:)`
- Products are no longer part of the paywall, they must be loaded separately with `.getPaywallProducts(paywall:)`
- It is no longer possible to use products outside of the paywall. If you need to handle a product, create a separate paywall for it (or for multiple products).
- `introductoryOfferEligibility` â€“ instead of true/false we give a more extended list of options
- The `AdaptyProfileParametersBuilder` is redesigned:
  - Methods, related to custom attributes now can throw an exception, if key or value didn't pass validation
  - Added an option to pass null values to builder functions for more convenience
  - You can now remove customAttributes with the function `.removeCustomAttribute("key")`
  - You have to use `.build()` method and pass resulting `AdaptyProfileParameters` object to `.updateProfile` method
- `.setAnalyticsDisabled()` method has been eliminated. Use the `.setAnalyticsDisabled` method of `AdaptyProfileParametersBuilder`.
- The `forceUpdate` parameter was removed from the `getPaywall` method. The result will always be up to date if it is possible to retrieve data from the server

## Renames
- `PurchaserInfo` renamed to `AdaptyProfile`
- `.getPurchaserInfo` renamed to `.getProfile`
- `didReceivePurchaserInfoStream` was also renamed to `.didUpdateProfileStream`
- `developerId` field of `AdaptyPaywall` was renamed to `id`
- `AdaptyAttributionNetwork` renamed to `AdaptyAttributionSource`

## Fixes
- Fixed wrong behavior of fallback paywalls in some cases
- `.setFallbackPaywalls()` method now does not return errors related to StoreKit product retrieval
- Incorrect user segmentation in some rare cases

## Additions:
- Ability to log onboard screens with `.logShowOnboarding()`. [Read more](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/onboarding-screens-tracking)
- Added ability to get previously set `customAttributes`, now it is part of `AdaptyProfile`

## Under the hood:
- The server interaction layer was rewritten from scratch.
- The initial request sequence has been optimized and simplified
- Reduced the number of API calls made by SDK. Some of the request are now faster and transfer less data.
- Independent requests can be executed simultaneously
- StoreKit interaction layer was refactored
