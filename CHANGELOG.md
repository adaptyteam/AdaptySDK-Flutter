#### Activation
- You no longer need to activate AdaptyUI separately, as it is now handled automatically during the usual activation process. Use `.withMediaCacheConfiguration` in AdaptyConfiguration if you wish to override the default settings:

```
await Adapty().activate(
  configuration: AdaptyConfiguration(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY')
    ..withMediaCacheConfiguration(...),
);

# 3.2.1
- `AdaptyErrorCode` change `final` to `const`
- [Android] Plugin fix

# 3.2.0

🎉 Meet the Adapty Flutter SDK 3.2.0!

With this version we're introducing support for the new paywall builder that offers more templates and layout flexibility. Note that:

- This version doesn't support paywalls created in the legacy (current) paywall builder
- But you can easily migrate those with a single press of a button in Adapty Dashboard


On top of that, this version also offers complete support of StoreKit 2 and Swift 6 on the iOS side. [See more here](https://github.com/adaptyteam/AdaptySDK-iOS/releases/tag/3.2.0). 

**Breaking Changes:**
- Adapty and AdaptyUI are now a single module, so you don't need to import them separately.
- `makePurchase` now returns `AdaptyPurchaseResult` instead of `AdaptyPurchasedInfo`.
- `getProductsIntroductoryOfferEligibility(products:)` has been removed. The `getPaywallProducts` function now returns a product object with prepopulated offer information. Consider using the `getPaywallProductsWithoutDeterminingOffer(paywall:)` method if you need to load products without determining offer eligibilities.
- `paywallViewDidFinishPurchase` now accepts `AdaptyPurchaseResult` instead of `AdaptyPurchasedInfo`.
- `paywallViewDidSelectProduct` now accepts `String`  (productId) instead of `AdaptyPaywallProduct`.
- `paywallViewDidCancelPurchase` has been removed. Please use the `purchaseResult` from `paywallViewDidFinishPurchase` to detect purchase cancellations.

# 2.10.4

# 2.10.0

⚠️ **Warning:** In this version, we have changed the minimal supported versions:

- The minimal iOS version is now 12.2.
- The minimal Xcode version is now 15.0.

⚠️ **Breaking Changes:**
- [iOS] We are no longer support `AdaptyStoreKit2Usage` parameter in the the `Adapty-Info.plist` method. Adapty SDK now utilizes the StoreKit 2 method for introductory offer eligibility checks if available.

# 2.9.3
- [Android] Fixed the incorrect format of some analytics events in rare cases.

# 2.9.2
- Added support for AdaptyUI 2.1.x
- [iOS] Fixed an issue with wrong device name in some cases on MacOS.

# 2.9.1

- [Android] Redesigned analytics event system
- [Android] Improved mechanism for usage logs collection

# 2.9.0

⚠️ **Warning**:
This version relies on StoreKit 2 instead of StoreKit 1. Starting from this version, you must connect your account to [Apple In-App Purchase API](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/in-app-purchase-api-storekit-2) in Adapty Dashboard. Otherwise, we won't be able to make or validate purchases.

**New**:

- Since this version we are using CDN. This technology helps us to synchronize data much faster.
- Added an option to retrieve paywalls from local cache by passing `fetchPolicy` parameter into `.getPaywall()` method
- Added an option to specify paywall fetching timeout by passing `loadTimeout` parameter into `.getPaywall()` method

Read More in our [documentation](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/displaying-products#getpaywall-parameters).

**Breaking Changes**:

- `placementId` parameter has been added to the `getPaywall` method, replacing the previously unnamed parameter `id`. [Read More](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/displaying-products)
- `AdaptyEnableUsageLogs` of `Adapty-Info.plist` is no longer supported, since this feature is enabled by default. [Read More](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/flutter-configuring#collecting-usage-logs-ios-only)
- If you will not put the `AdaptyStoreKit2Usage` parameter to `Adapty-Info.plist`, the default value will be `.forIntroEligibilityCheck` (this means that by default we will fetch introductory offers eligibility using StoreKit 2).

- [iOS] Introduced a new functionality for retrieving introductory offers eligibility using StoreKit 2. To fetch it, you should now use a separate method called .getProductsIntroductoryOfferEligibility. The behavior of this function depends on your Adapty SDK configuration. It will utilize StoreKit 2 if available or fallback to a legacy logic based on receipt analysis. For more detailed information, please refer to our documentation. [Read more](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/displaying-products#adapty-sdk-version-250-and-higher)

Meet the second version of the Adapty SDK 🎉

See our [What's new in Adapty Flutter SDK 2.0 doc](https://docs.adapty.io/v2.0/docs/migration-to-flutter-2) for API updates.
Adapty 2.0 introduces the following updates:

## Breaking changes:

- Adapty now is singleton. Use `Adapty().someMethodCall()` instead of `Adapty.someMethodCall()`
- User-initiated purchases are now automatically processed by the system, so we have removed the `deferredPurchasesStream` and `makeDeferredPurchase()` method.
- We are no longer support Visual Paywalls and Promo Campaigns features, so you should remove the calls to the corresponding methods, if there were any
- Instead of getting all paywalls in one request with the `.getPaywalls()`, it must be done separately for each paywall using `.getPaywall(id:)`
- Products are no longer part of the paywall, they must be loaded separately with `.getPaywallProducts(paywall:)`
- It is no longer possible to use products outside of the paywall. If you need to handle a product, create a separate paywall for it (or for multiple products).
- `introductoryOfferEligibility` – instead of true/false we give a more extended list of options
- The `AdaptyProfileParametersBuilder` is redesigned:
  - Methods, related to custom attributes now can throw an exception, if key or value didn't pass validation
  - Added an option to pass null values to builder functions for more convenience
  - You can now remove customAttributes with the function `.removeCustomAttribute("key")`
  - You have to use `.build()` method and pass resulting `AdaptyProfileParameters` object to `.updateProfile` method
- `.setAnalyticsDisabled()` method has been eliminated. Use the `.setAnalyticsDisabled` method of `AdaptyProfileParametersBuilder`.
- The `forceUpdate` parameter was removed from the `getPaywall` method. The result will always be up to date if it is possible to retrieve data from the server

## Renames

- `PurchaserInfo` renamed to `AdaptyProfile`
- `.getPurchaserInfo` renamed to `.getProfile`
- `didReceivePurchaserInfoStream` was also renamed to `.didUpdateProfileStream`
- `developerId` field of `AdaptyPaywall` was renamed to `id`
- `AdaptyAttributionNetwork` renamed to `AdaptyAttributionSource`

## Fixes

- Fixed wrong behavior of fallback paywalls in some cases
- `.setFallbackPaywalls()` method now does not return errors related to StoreKit product retrieval
- Incorrect user segmentation in some rare cases

## Additions:

- Ability to log onboard screens with `.logShowOnboarding()`. [Read more](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/onboarding-screens-tracking)
- Added ability to get previously set `customAttributes`, now it is part of `AdaptyProfile`

## Under the hood:

- The server interaction layer was rewritten from scratch.
- The initial request sequence has been optimized and simplified
- Reduced the number of API calls made by SDK. Some of the request are now faster and transfer less data.
- Independent requests can be executed simultaneously
- StoreKit interaction layer was refactored
