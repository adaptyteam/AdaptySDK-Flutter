This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Adapty Flutter SDK (`adapty_flutter`) — a Flutter plugin for in-app subscriptions, paywalls, and onboardings via Adapty's backend. Supports iOS (13.0+) and Android (SDK 21+).

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests (only the example app has tests)
cd example && flutter test

# Analyze Dart code
flutter analyze

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build example app
cd example && flutter build ios --no-codesign
cd example && flutter build apk
```

There is no custom Makefile, CI config, or lint script in this repo. The linting config is minimal — `analysis_options.yaml` sets max line length to 120.

## Architecture

### Plugin Structure (Method Channel)

The SDK is a standard Flutter plugin using **MethodChannel** (`flutter.adapty.com/adapty`) for Dart↔Native communication:

- **Dart side:** `lib/src/adapty.dart` — singleton `Adapty` class with all public API methods. `AdaptyUI` is defined via `part 'adaptyui.dart'` in the same library.
- **Android side:** `android/src/main/kotlin/com/adapty/flutter/AdaptyFlutterPlugin.kt` — bridges to the native Android Adapty SDK (dependency via BOM in `android/build.gradle`).
- **iOS side:** `ios/Classes/SwiftAdaptyFlutterPlugin.swift` — bridges to the native iOS Adapty SDK (dependency via CocoaPods in `ios/adapty_flutter.podspec`).

All method names and argument keys are centralized in `lib/src/constants/method.dart` and `lib/src/constants/argument.dart`.

### Cross-Platform Protocol

`cross_platform.yaml` (root) is a JSON Schema defining the request/response contract between Dart and native code. When adding or changing a method, this schema should stay in sync.

### Models & Serialization

All data models live in `lib/src/models/`. Each model has a corresponding `*JSONBuilder` in `lib/src/models/private/` that handles JSON serialization/deserialization. The base helpers (`Map<String, dynamic>` extensions for typed access) are in `lib/src/models/private/json_builder.dart`.

Public exports are controlled via `lib/adapty_flutter.dart` using explicit `show` clauses.

### Event System

Observer interfaces (`AdaptyUIPaywallsEventsObserver`, `AdaptyUIOnboardingsEventsObserver`) in `lib/src/adaptyui_observer.dart` handle native→Dart callbacks. Event routing goes through `lib/src/adaptyui_events_proxy.dart`. Profile updates use a broadcast `StreamController`.

### Platform Views

Native paywall and onboarding views are embedded via `PlatformView` widgets in `lib/src/platform_views/`. Corresponding native view factories are in the Android/iOS directories.

## Key Patterns

- **Singletons:** `Adapty()` and `AdaptyUI()` are singleton factories.
- **Builders:** Configuration objects use the builder pattern (`AdaptyConfigurationBuilder`, `AdaptyProfileParametersBuilder`, `AdaptyPurchaseParametersBuilder`).
- **JSON round-trip:** Native calls return `Map<String, dynamic>` decoded from JSON. Models are constructed from these maps via their JSON builders; outgoing data uses `jsonValue` getters.

## Git Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, etc.
- Do not add "Co-Authored-By" lines to commit messages.

## Version Coordination

Version bumps require updating multiple files in lockstep:

- `pubspec.yaml` — Dart package version
- `android/build.gradle` — Android native SDK BOM version and crossplatform version
- `ios/adapty_flutter.podspec` — iOS native SDK dependency versions
- `CHANGELOG.md`
